### Description :
This is a website for an early stage fintech app. Through this website, the team wants to let the world know about their app and let the users get in touch with them for user-testing process.
### Link to project: https://hejfin.com

### How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, SCSS, JS.

This responsive website has been built using html and scss. Tweeks like mobile menu, hiding and displaying calender etc have been done using Javascript. Css section has been given a really fine structure using SCSS. It makes maintainance and debugging easier. 
Scss gives many added functionality to css like mixins, functions, looping, nesting etc. to name a few.
### Optimizations
Separate pages could be added to provide the users more info about the team and their current status

### Lessons Learned:
Building a site using SCSS with proper structure has been an amazing experience for me. I have tried learning from good quality free templates and tried to understand the way styling is divided into components and later imported into a single scss file.
